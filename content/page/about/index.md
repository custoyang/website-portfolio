### Education
Hello! I am a second year student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science.

### Passions and Interests
Cooking - Shows like MasterChef kindled my passion for cooking. The artistry displayed by professional chefs dedicating their time and effort into perfecting their craft has been a source of inspiration. The experiences of observing others in the kitchen motivated me to cook myself.

Exercising - Over the past two years, my gym attendance has been inconsistent. However, I've recently committed to makign regular exercise a priority by setting it as my New Year's resolution. Each morning I wake up early to go on a run. In the evening, I dedicate time to weighlifting at the gym. My goal is to cultivate a lifestyle that prioritizes health and fitness.

Sports - I love to play and watch sports. During high school I actively participated in track & field and soccer. However, beyond playing I am an avid fan of various professional sports, including the NBA, NHL, Champion's League, and many more. My enthusiasm extends to competing with friends in fantasy basketball every season.
