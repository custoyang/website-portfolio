### Introduction
Creating your own personal website has never been easier with the abundance of accessible tools available. In this post, I'll share my journey of setting up my website using Hugo and deploying it on GitHub Pages. Leveraging the GitHub platform ensures a seamless experience from the initial build to the deployment of the site. 

* This website will serve as an archive and documentation for myself when I forget how I developed and created a project in the past. 

### GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages functions as a static site hosting service, taking HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from a GitHub repository. It also offers the option to run these files through a build process before publishing the website. GitHub Pages makes it easy and optimal to host static websites like blogs, portfolios, and project documentation.
