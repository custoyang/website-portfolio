### Background
AWS Deepracer is an innovative educational initiative launched by Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed to introduce and educate users on machine learning (ML) through a fun and engaging method. It is essentially a competition that combines machine learning with a physical, autonomous, 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning technique where an algorithm learns to perform tasks by trying them out and then learning from the outcomes.

Participants in AWS Deepracer engage in developing, training, and fine-tuning reinforcement learning models in a virtual environment provided by AWS. These models are then deployed to the physical Deepracer cars, which compete by racing on a real track. The goal is to create a model that enables the car to complete the track as quickly as possible, autonomously, without human intervention.

### Introduction
This weekend I had the opportunity to participate in the AWS Deepracer competition, organized by the Artificial Intelligence club at UCI. It was a super fun experience that not only challenged my technical skills but also expanded my professional network. This event attracted a diverse group of people, ranging from freshman to seniors to professionals working at Amazon Web Services in the Irvine area. The professionals played a pivotal role in setting up, organizing, and hosting the competition, ensuring an awesome experience for everyone.

I was able to meet so many amazing people from different majors, including software engineering, informatics, and data science. It was an exceptional opportunity to meet new people, share insights, and learn from those with different focuses and expertise in the computer science field. This event not only highlighted the importance of practical hands-on experience in AI and machine learning but also underscored the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and community building within the tech industry.

* Thank you to everybody that organized the event!
